For the 50 employees I had overall responsibility for, I implemented monthly professional days and social events that measurably strengthened both team spirit and cross-disciplinary collaboration. On the recruitment side, I successfully attracted and hired 5 top talents with increasing retention. This was achieved through close and well-structured collaboration with People & Culture, where we jointly developed a recruitment program that reduced time-to-hire by 20% without compromising quality. For new hires, I created a structured onboarding program that reduced the time to full productivity from 4 to 2 months. One of my most important contributions was the standardization of development processes across all four Tech Hubs in Europe (Oslo, Stockholm, Tallinn, and Berlin). This harmonization resulted in a 30% increase in delivery capacity and enabled a common technical platform that accelerated time to market. Through systematic work to create a work environment characterized by psychological safety and a healthy error culture, I increased employee satisfaction compared to previously reported values. This also fostered innovation in the organization. My emphasis on physical presence in the office, combined with structured knowledge sharing through tools like Atlassian Confluence, has created a dynamic work environment where both individuals and teams can develop and deliver high-quality results.",

In my leadership role, I was responsible for a leadership group of 2 team leaders, where I implemented structured leadership development programs that improved their ability to effectively lead teams and follow up on personnel. This resulted in measurable improvements in team performance and delivery quality. In parallel, I had direct personnel responsibility for 11 engineers, where I increased both productivity and job satisfaction through regular one-on-one meetings and career plans. My present leadership created a work environment characterized by high psychological safety, which led to increased innovation and problem-solving ability within the team. Through strategic communication about the company's direction and future prospects, I built trusting relationships with employees, reducing uncertainty and strengthening engagement even during periods of change. By effectively using tools like Microsoft Office, Atlassian Jira, and Confluence, I optimized project management and knowledge sharing, resulting in more streamlined workflows and better cross-disciplinary collaboration. This contributed to both higher delivery quality and increased employee satisfaction, as documented through improved results in internal surveys.",
